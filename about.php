                    <p>The school started in a modest way in 1915 as a Boys’ Primary School at the current Machakos Girls grounds. It was known as African Government School. It was not until 1939 that it changed into a boys Secondary School. In 1946 the first batch of girls were admitted making it a mixed school. It used to take students up to Form 2. The Principal of the school then was called Mr. Martin making the school to be referred to by the locals as “KwaMatingi” a corruption of for “At Martins”.

                        Later the need to separate the girls from the boys arose and in 1950 the boys were relocated to the present site of Machakos School. It admitted African students only and hence the name “GovernmentAfricanBoysSchool”.
                        The first Principal who was a Foreigner (1950) was called CROWFORD who stayed for 4 years only. Six other Foreigner Principals followed, namely;
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Symons: 1954 – 56</li>
                        <li>Gregory: 1956 – 57</li>
                        <li>Ryton: 1957 – 59</li>
                        <li>Spranger: 1959 – 62</li>
                        <li>Appleby: 1962 – 63</li>
                        <li>Noble: 1963 – 65 (The last Foreigner Principal)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The first Kenyan Principal was the legendary Ishmael J. Omondi under whose leadership the school grew to become a living giant in curricular and co-curricular not only in Kenya but in East Africa. He left in 1971 to become the registrar at the then KenyattaUniversityCollege and later moved to Kenya Institute of Education (K.I.E) where he eventually retired.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. Omondi there followed other Principals. These are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mason (Foreigner): 1971 – 1972</li>
                        <li>P.M. Makau: 1972 – 1977</li>
                        <li>J.M. Wambua: 1977 – 1978</li>
                        <li>B.K Kisilu: 1978 – 1979</li>
                        <li>T. Mwove: 1979 – 1980</li>
                        <li>P.M. Kitwii: 1980 – 1981</li>
                        <li>J.A.M Nzeki: 1981 – 1986</li>
                        <li>C.M. Muthuka: 1987 – 1989</li>
                        <li>P.D Matolo: 1990 – 1996</li>
                        <li>B.N Kavita: 1996 – 1997</li>
                        <li>M.T. Wambua: 1997 – 2000</li>
                        <li>J.P Mackenzie: 2000 – 2002</li>
                        <li>D.P.K Kilonzi: 2002 – 2009</li>
                        <li>M. Masaku: 2009– to date</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>During that time, the majority of the teaching staff were Foreigners (mainly British and American expatriates). There was a handful of African teachers. But the Africanisation and hence Kenyanisation Programme saw the African teachers replace the Foreigner teachers. To date the school is manned 100% by Kenyan teachers.</p>
                    <p>Over time the school has grown from a 3 streamed school to a 5 streamed one with a student’s population of about 1000. Since its inception more than 11,000 students have gone through MachakosSchool. The school has been able to offer a wide curriculum and external exams. When it started in 1950 it could only teach up to Form 2 and was offering an exam called “Kenya Junior Secondary Examination. (K.J.S.E). Later in mid 50’s the school started offering exams atForm 4 level where it was doing “General Certificate of Education” set in U.K by Cambridge University Syndicate. This exam was done incorporated with (E.A.C.E) AST African Certificate of Education Exam, which was done in collaboration with other African countries. (TZ &amp; UG), Malaysia and U.K. This later became Kenya Certificate of Education (K.C.E) which was abolished in 1989. Students would do 8 subjects but 6 would be considered for grading. It was replaced by K.C.S.E.The school introduced a Higher School Course (HSC) in 1965 where it was offering 2 disciplines;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>2 Arts Classes (35 students)</li>
                        <li>1 Science class (25 students)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This course was for 2 years and at the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> year (Form Six) one would do an exam called E.A.A.C.E (East African Advanced Certificate of Education Exam) which later became Kenya Advanced Certificate of Education Exam which came to an end in 1989 when it was abolished. It was at the end of this course that one would proceed to the University if one qualified. It was through the good performance of the school that it managed to send so many students to the University both locally and internationally who have been able to hold big positions in the country and in other countries.</p>
                    <p>The school performance in exams has remained good both Form 4 and Form 6 most notably in 1973 where the school topped in East Africa and 2006 where the school had the best pass after the introduction of the 8-4-4 system. As far as the infrastructure is concerned, the school started with bricked classrooms but later more classrooms were added to cater for the expansion of the student’s population.</p>
                    <p>3 Dormitories that were initially constructed:-</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mwatu</li>
                        <li>Masaku</li>
                        <li>Mathendu</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Then Musau followed. Ngei was constructed in 1969. Muindi Mbingu and lastly Omondi.</p>
                    <p>The School is under face-lifting with some of the buildings being pulled down such as the Administration Block, The Assembly Hall which at one time used to be the Dining Hall has been expanded and turned to an Assembly Hall.</p>
                    <p>The parents have been very supportive in financing these development projects.</p>
                    <p>Also, having been uplifted to the National status in 2011 under the leadership of Mr. MuiyaMasaku, the current Chief Principal, much is being done in all spheres to make the school be at par with the other National school in the country.</p>
                    <p>This is evident in the manner in which curriculum is being implemented (both curricular and&nbsp;co-curricular. The discipline of the students is also becoming something to be emulated.</p>
